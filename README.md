# Pre-Emptive-Scheduling-with-Priority-Inheritance
Pre-emptive Scheduling with Priority Inheritance for n processes with Multiple Critical Sections

Assumptions - The processes are given according to their starting time
Note - Higher priority value implies greater priority

1. Complie and run FINAL.cpp
2. Enter the number of processes
3. Enter the details for each process:
   a. Priority of process
   b. Starting time of process
   c. Duration of process
   d. Number of Critical Sections
   e. Time at which each critical section starts
   f. Duration of each critical section
   g. Resources required during the critical section

Output will give the running process after each time quantum and finally list the process end times
